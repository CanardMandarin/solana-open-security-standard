## Description

The "Arithmetic" class of vulnerabilities encompasses issues related to numerical calculations and operations. These vulnerabilities can result from miscalculations, improper handling of numeric types, or inadequately validated data, leading to unintended and potentially harmful consequences.

This class consists of three subclasses, each highlighting specific arithmetic-related weaknesses:

1. [Integer overflow/underflow](./integer_overflow.md)
2. [Rounding errors](./rounding_errors.md)
