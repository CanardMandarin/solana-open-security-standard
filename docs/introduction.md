# Introduction

**Solana Open Security Standard** (SOSS) is a proposition of a security **awareness standard** for Solana. Our intention is to establish a consensus about the most common security risks of Solana programs.

This document is free and open to anyone interested in Solana programs security. SOSS aims to educate Solana developers and organizations about security and the consequence of weaknesses. 

*Note: **Solana Open Security Standard** should remain neutral and free from any commercial pressure. This is why SOSS will never endorse or recommend specific products or services.*

# Terminology 

**Solana Open Security Standard** uses the same terminology as Solana's [official documentation](https://docs.solana.com/terminology).
