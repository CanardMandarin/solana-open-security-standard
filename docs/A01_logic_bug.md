# Description

The Logic Bug class encompasses vulnerabilities that arise from errors in the logical flow of a program's code. Unlike other types of bugs that might cause immediate failures or errors, logic bugs create subtle loopholes in the code that lead to unexpected and undesired behavior during the execution.

These vulnerabilities manifest when the program successfully executes without any apparent issues, but the outcomes are not as intended or predicted. Such discrepancies can potentially open up security loopholes and create opportunities for attackers. Logic bugs are often the result of mistakes, oversights, or incorrect assumptions made during the development process.

One key challenge with logic bugs is that they may not be easily detectable through traditional testing methods or static code analysis. Since the code technically executes without errors, identifying logic bugs typically requires comprehensive and meticulous review of the program's logic flow and potential edge cases.
