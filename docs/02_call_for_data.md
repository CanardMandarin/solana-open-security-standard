# Call For Data

As stated in the methodology section, the security standard is designed to be objective and relies on data derived from public audits and known exploits. The accuracy and effectiveness of the standard heavily depend on the quality and comprehensiveness of the data set.

To continually enhance the standard, we actively encourage the community to contribute by providing new reports or sharing known exploits that might have been overlooked. We welcome and appreciate any contributions that can help complete and refine the data set. Feel free to open a pull request to contribute to the data set, ensuring that the standard remains as comprehensive and reflective of the real-world as possible.
